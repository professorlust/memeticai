XML Debug Batch File
This formats Bioware's logs to be readable with Internet Explorer.

Installation & Usage

1. Copy the files into your NWN/logs directory.
2. Set the debug level of your module or add your own _Start()
   and _End() calls. Refer to the documentation for more information.
3. Run your module, exit the client application.
4. Run the log.bat batch script. You should see a log.xml file.
5. View the log.xml file with an XML Viewier, or Internet Explorer,
   you should have a collapsable trace log.

Additional Notes

 * If you are running in server mode, you may need to change the
   logfile name referenced in the log.bat script. You start your
   module using the standalone server application found in your
   NWN directory. This is usually done to quickly run start/stop
   your module and inspect a specific scenerio you're debugging.
 
 * The NWN client only clears the log when you exit from the
   client entirely. If you run your module in a windowed mode
   and you restart the module you are debuggin, you will have your
   debug appended to the log. This may not be what you want.
 
 * If there are errors in the XML Internet Explorer will show the
   error at the end of the file. This usually occurs when a function
   calls return; before _End();
