MemeticAI Toolkit Install Notes

Requirements

* This project assumes you have Bioware's Neverwinter Nights game engine installed.
  Please visit http://nwn.bioware.com/ for information about Neverwinter Nights.

* The toolkit does not require Bioware's SoU or HoU expansion pack.
  It does not require any hack packs, although a few predefined blueprints must exist.
  These blueprints are available in the /erf directory.
  
Installation

1. Using Bioware's toolkit, open your existing module, or start a new module.

2. Find your NWN modules\temp0 directory. (c:\NeverwinterNights\nwn\modules\temp0)
   This directory has the files from your module. It is created automatically when 
   you open your module in the toolkit.
  
3. Copy the contents of nss/* to your temp0\ directory. You should have checked this
   directory out from the CVS repository.

4. Import the base erf located in /erf. This includes a few items you will never use
   and a special area you will never visit. They are used by the toolkit.

5. Attach the cb_* scripts to your module and area callbacks. If you are using your own
   binding system, like HCR, you may want to add ExecuteScript("cb_..."); to your
   existing callback scripts. The critical callback is OnModuleLoad found in the module
   properties dialog.

6. Go to your module properties dialog and enable script caching. Add all of the lib_*
   scripts. Add all of the h_* scripts. This will dramatically improve performance.
  
7. Finally, you can drop out a creature and attach the cb_* scripts. There are several
   example spawn scripts prefixed with s_.
